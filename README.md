This map is a REM (relative elevation model), constructed from a 2x2m DEM provided by Maanmittauslaitos. It highlights the ice age ridge line of Raasepori, Finland.
The rendered data attached here in Github are compressed version, as the original files are quite large. However, they allow you to look at the finished model for yourself, although at a low resolution.
